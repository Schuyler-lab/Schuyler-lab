### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub account! I am an aspiring Data Scientist, currently in the first year of a two year Master's in Applied Data Science at the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management. I will be sure to keep my GitHub updated with any potentially interesting projects that I think might be worth sharing. As I write this, the only such project I've contributed to is "Bikerus"; a data analytics project endeavouring to predict demand for bike rentals from Washington D.C.'s Capital Bikeshare. The corresponding repository can be accessed here: https://github.com/Estreuselito/bikerus. 

- âš¡ Random Fun fact: Though I admitedly haven't yet tried it out myself, word is Doritos are quite flammable, if you're ever in a pinch and need some fire starter give 'em a shot!
